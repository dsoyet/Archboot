ATTENTION:\n
----------\n
You are running in BIOS/MBR mode.\n\n
Do you want to use GUID Partition Table (GPT)?\n\n
As a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard,\n
it can also be used on BIOS systems, because of the limitations of MBR\n
aka MS-DOS partition tables, which restrict maximum disk size to 2TB.\n
Windows 10 and later versions are able to boot from a GPT disk.\n\n
Consideration:\n
- Please check if your other operating systems have GPT support!\n
- Use this option for a GRUB(2) setup, which should support LVM, RAID\n
  etc., which doesn't fit into the usual 30k MS-DOS post-MBR gap.\n
- BIOS-GPT boot may not work on some old Lenovo systems (irrespective of\n
  the bootloader used).
