LUKS ENCRYPTION SUMMARY:\n
------------------------\n\n
Encryption is useful for two (related) reasons. Firstly, it prevents any-\n
one with physical access to your computer, and your storage drive in par-\n
ticular, from getting the data from it(unless they have your passphrase or\n
key). Secondly, it allows you to wipe the data on your storage drive with\n
far more confidence in the event of you selling or discarding your drive.\n
Basically, it supplements the access control mechanisms of the operating\n
system (like file permissions) by making it harder to bypass the operating\n
system by inserting a bootable medium, for example. Encrypting the root\n
partition prevents anyone from using this method to insert viruses or tro-\n
jans onto your computer.\n\n
ATTENTION:\n
Having encrypted devices does not protect you from all possible attacks.\n
The encryption is only as good as your key management, and there are other\n
ways to break into computers, while they are running.
