LOGICAL VOLUME SUMMARY:\n
-----------------------------\n\n
LVM is a Logical Volume Manager for the Linux kernel. With LVM you can\n
abstract your storage space and have "virtual partitions" which are easier\n
to modify.\n\nThe basic building block of LVM are:\n
- Physical volume (PV):\n
  Partition on storage disk (or even storage disk itself or loopback file)\n
  on which you can have virtual groups. It has a special header and is\n
  divided into physical extents. Think of physical volumes as big building\n
  blocks which can be used to build your storage drive.\n
- Volume group (VG):\n
  Group of physical volumes that are used as storage volume (as one disk).\n
  They contain logical volumes. Think of volume groups as storage drives.\n
- Logical volume(LV):\n
  A "virtual/logical partition" that resides in a volume group and is\n
  composed of physical extents. Think of logical volumes as normal\n
  partitions.
