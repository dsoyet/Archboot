LINUX SOFTWARE RAID SUMMARY:\n
-----------------------------\n\n
Linear mode:\n
You have two or more partitions which are not necessarily the same size\n
(but of course can be), which you want to append to each other.Spare-\n
disks are not supported here. If a disk dies, the array dies with it.\n\n
RAID-0:\n
You have two or more devices, of approximately the same size, and you want\n
to combine their storage capacity and also combine their performance by\n
accessing them in parallel. Like in Linear mode, spare disks are not sup-\n
ported here either. RAID-0 has no redundancy, so when a disk dies, the\n
array goes with it.\n\n
RAID-1:\n
You have two devices of approximately same size, and you want the two to\n
be mirrors of each other. Eventually you have more devices, which you want\n
to keep as stand-by sparedisks, that will automatically become a part of\n
the mirror if one of the active devices break.\n\n
RAID-4:\n
You have three or more devices of roughly the same size and you want a way\n
that protects data against loss of any one disk.Fault tolerance is a-\n
chieved by adding an extra disk to the array, which is dedicated to stor\n
ing parity information. The overall capacity of the array is reduced by \n
one disk.The storage efficiency is 66 percent. With six drives, the sto-\n
rage efficiency is 87 percent. The main disadvantage is poor performance\n
for multiple, simultaneous, and independent read/write operations. Thus,\n
if any disk fails, all data stay intact. But if two disks fail,all data is\n
lost.\n\n
RAID-5:\n
You have three or more devices of roughly the same size, you want to com-\n
bine them into a larger device, but still to maintain a degree of redun-\n
dancy for data safety. Eventually you have a number of devices to use as\n
sparedisks, that will not take part in the array before another device\n
fails. If you use N devices where the smallest has size S, the size of the\n
entire array will be (N-1)*S. This "missing" space is used for parity\n
(redundancy) information. Thus, if any disk fails, all data stay intact.\n
But if two disks fail, all data is lost.\n\n
RAID-6:\n
You have four or more devices of roughly the same size and you wanta way\n
that protects data against loss of any two disks.Fault tolerance is a-\
chieved by adding an two extra disk to the array, which is dedicated to\n
storing parity information. The overall capacity of the array is reduced\n
by 2 disks. Thus, if any two disks fail, all data stay intact. But if \n
3 disks fail, all data is lost.\n\n
RAID-10:\n
Shorthand for RAID1+0, a mirrored striped array and needs a minimum of two\n
disks. It provides superior data security and can survive multiple disk \n
failures. The main disadvantage is cost, because 50% of your storage is du-\n
plication.
